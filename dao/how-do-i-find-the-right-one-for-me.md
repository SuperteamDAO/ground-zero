Like NFTs, the right DAO can be different for different people. The best way to figure out what different communities are doing is to wet your feet in the waters a little and join their Discord/Twitter and see if the DAO's goals and vibes align with yours.

The best part here is that you're never tied to a particular organisation. You have all the freedom to join as many or as few communities as you want, and take up work as much as your bandwidth allows.

Check out the landscape in Cooper Turley's article below and see what appeals to you.
