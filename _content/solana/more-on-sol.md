Given the astronomical rise of Solana, its token SOL has taken the markets by storm in the last 12 months. It began the year at a modest price of $1.52 and has since surged by a stunning 11,150%.

SOL is used in all transactions and smart contract operations within the Solana Ecosystem. The coin is also staked to help secure the network, earning rewards for users.

Its rise can be attributed to the growth of the Solana blockchain in general. Many users in the past few months have shifted to Solana due to its lower gas fees and higher transaction speeds.

Numerous NFT projects on Solana have also recently exploded, forming a strong community of artists on the platform. DeFi applications have been a significant part of this rise. According to DeFi Llama, a total of $11 billion of total value has been invested in DeFi projects built on Solana, and the future looks even more promising.
