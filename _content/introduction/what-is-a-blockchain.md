An interesting analogy for understanding blockchain is a Google Doc.

When you create one and share it with a group of people, the document is distributed instead of copied or transferred while giving access to everyone. Every change is recorded in real-time with a transparent history of who made what change to the document.

A Blockchain is an open-source ledger that works in a similar manner. It is a database that stores encrypted blocks of data then chains them together to form a chronological single-source-of-truth for the data.

Digital assets, most commonly Cryptocurrencies in Web3, are distributed instead of copied or transferred, creating an immutable record of an asset. The asset is decentralized, allowing full real-time access and transparency to the public.
