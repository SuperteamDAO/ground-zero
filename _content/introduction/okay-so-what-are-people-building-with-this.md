Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto came up with Bitcoin back in 2009, Blockchain technology's popularity has skyrocketed in the world due to its decentralised, immutable and completely transparent nature.

And the use cases are not limited to just cryptocurrencies, Blockchain right now is being used in a ton of industries ranging from BFSI, healthcare, education to real estate, supply chain & logistics, IoT etc. These are some of the use cases that might be worth mentioning.

### Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts have to be one of the most popular use cases of the Blockchain. These are basically pieces of code that follow relatively simple commands of "when/if _then_\_\_" to ensure that all parties receive the benefits or penalties as the contract stipulates and actions require. It also makes a permanent record of every action and reaction in the transaction that takes place on it.

### Money Transfer

Who does not love instant money transfers?

The Blockchain enables lightning-fast transactions in real-time. This has already transformed the BFSI sector for good as it saves both time and money (mostly eliminates transaction fees charged by centralised banks/financial institutions).&#x20;
