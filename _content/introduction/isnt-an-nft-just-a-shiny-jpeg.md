**And then, there were NFTs.**

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have to be the most talked-about entities in the whole crypto ecosystem right now. A lot of people know about them because of CryptoPunks, Bored Apes and Nyan Cats, but there's much more to this than meets the eye.

NFTs are unique (Non-fungible) digital items with blockchain-managed ownership. Examples include collectibles, game items, digital art, event tickets, domain names, and even ownership records for physical assets.

This makes it possible for every creator, artist, musician or developer out there to have full ownership and management permission over their intellectual or digital property.

But that isn't it. NFTs have proven to be one of the most versatile digital assets one can own on the blockchain as they give anyone to not just own a digital asset, but the ability to also work with the following use cases.

- Standardisation
- Interoperability
- Tradability
- Liquidity
- Programmability
- And probably the most important point in this list, provable scarcity.
