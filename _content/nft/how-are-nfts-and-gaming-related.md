The Gaming industry has probably gained the most out of the NFT Boom that we've witnessed over the last couple of years.

Games like Axie Infinity and Decentraland have given utility to NFTs and made digital ecosystems around it for players to interact with, just like they do IRL.

*Why the success?*

Let's take an example here. What if the house you bought in Grand Theft Auto was actually, verifiably yours to own and digitally live in? Any other player that drives by can only wish they bought it before you did. This is how real life has always worked, but we're entering a world where digital life works the same way as well.

From gun skins to digital property, gaming and NFTs are a match made in the Metaverse heaven, and the future possibilities are endless.
