**Well, it depends.**

Every DAO has its own set of rules, tokens and tokenomics which govern the hierarchy and the treasury of the DAO.,

Tokenomics here means economics around tokens and the project it supports. There are multiple factors that govern the direction that a tokenomics of a DAO can take like:

- Supply and demand
- Liquidity
- Inflation

The 2 most common requirements for any kind of DAO is the need of a community of people and the capital in its treasury. People working on building products, content, design for the DAO can generate income for themselves this way and in turn create income for the DAO subsequently.

Some DAOs, like the Superteam DAO prefer to not have their own token, but use a reputation system for governance and pay members with stablecoins. The tweet thread given below expands on this point of view effectively if you choose to go down that rabbit hole.
