A Google Doc is a good analogy to explain the basics of blockchain.

When you create and share a document with a group, it is distributed to the connected accounts/devices instead of being copied or transferred, and everyone has access to it. Google also transparently shows the version history of who made what change when to this shared document.

Think of blockchain as an open-source digital book of accounts that works similarly. It stores a batch of transactions as encrypted blocks of data. The blocks are chained together to form a chronological single-source-of-truth for the data. The secret sauce is that this data is distributed to a series of connected devices called nodes. Nodes verify the blocks and maintain the security and integrity of the network.

Digital assets, most commonly Cryptocurrencies in Web3, are distributed instead of copied or transferred, creating an immutable record of an asset. The asset is decentralized via nodes (connected devices), allowing full real-time access and transparency to the public.

Formally, a blockchain is defined as a _public, permanent, append-only, distributed ledger_.
